Hyun-soo, after a failed relationship with Eunjoo (played by Han Ga In) , decides that he will no longer put up with the conduct of Jong-hun and his boys as well as the harsh and violent disciplinary techniques being put up by the teachers, and starts to train himself in Jeet Kune Do, inspired by his greatest hero Bruce Lee. His father, a martial artist, frequently resorted to minor violence to discipline his son.



Hyun-soo challenges Jong-hun to a duel one day when he is no longer able to put up with his behaviour, an epic fight scene ensues. Jong-hun and his friends are grievously injured by Hyun-soo's nunchaku. Hyun-soo is expelled after this incident.



Hyun-soo meets his friend Hamburger again at the GED institute and they talk about their past. He meets Eunjoo again, but they say their goodbyes on a bus. Jackie Chan's 1978 movie Drunken Master is featured in the background at the end of the movie as Hamburger and Hyun-soo play a fighting game in front of the cinema complex."
